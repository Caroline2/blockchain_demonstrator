      <li>Run one of the blockchain_5003.py or blockchain_5004.py files in your IDE and change the all the port numbers in the file to be the same (5003 if you have chosen he blockchain_5003.py file or 5004 if you have chosen the he blockchain_5003.py file).</li>
    <li>Open one tab in your browser and type localhost:5003 or localhost:5004 depending on which file you have chosen.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>For two-nodes use:
    <ol>
  <li>Split the terminal in your IDE and run the blockchain_5003.py and blockchain_5004.py file at the same time.</li>

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Enjoy the app!</li>
